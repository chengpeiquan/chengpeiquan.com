The eighth tattoo design is a cluster of spider webs. While the main purpose was to fill some blank space on my arm, its meaning happened to resonate deeply with the situation I was facing at the time.

In 2020, I found myself at a crossroads in life. I was still working at a big tech company, and on the surface, everything seemed stable. But in reality, it felt like being a frog in warm water—slowly boiling, mentally and physically exhausted over time.

The constraints of the work environment meant I had very limited exposure to new technologies. There were many things I wanted to explore and build up experience in, but I simply didn’t have the opportunity. For a while, I even found myself working just for the sake of working—something that felt deeply wrong to me and went against my long-held attitude toward work.

I wanted to grow and improve, but it was incredibly difficult to do so in that environment. On the other hand, I was hesitant to leave because I wasn’t sure if I’d find another opportunity at the same level. I went back and forth in my mind for a long time, feeling stuck.

Eventually, the ancient Chinese saying "Instead of yearning for fish by the water, better to weave your own net" struck a chord with me. Rather than wasting time in frustration, I decided it was time to take action and build a new path for myself.

After making the decision to leave, life actually became more free and joyful. With fewer constraints, I found myself exposed to a wider range of exciting and meaningful things. I later published my own technical book, joined a much more dynamic and driven team, and now I’m working on a product that I find more interesting than anything I’ve done before. All of these experiences continue to affirm that I made the right choice.
