Having lived in Guangzhou for years, I’ve grown deeply attached to its neighborhoods, its people, and the unique rhythm of life here. Guangzhou is also known as the "City of Rams", so I always wanted a tattoo that paid tribute to the city—with a ram as the central motif.

Herbal tea is a daily ritual in Guangzhou, and saying "grab a bottle of 癍痧" has become our most common group order at the office. So the final design features a ram carrying a medicine box on its back and holding a traditional palm-leaf fan in its mouth—symbolizing protection from illness, peace, and good fortune.

The name "Sanyang Kaitai" (三阳开泰) is drawn from a traditional Chinese blessing that marks the arrival of good fortune and harmony.

> Note on 癍痧: It’s a type of bottled herbal tea popular in southern China, often believed to help with heat and minor ailments. There’s no perfect English translation, but it’s a cultural staple in places like Guangzhou.
