I’m a front-end developer, sometimes dabbling in product design and a bit of not-so-serious full-stack work.

I grew up in Chaozhou’s ancient town and now live in Guangzhou. I’ve always been surrounded by Lingnan and Hong Kong culture, and I mostly speak Cantonese and Teochew in daily life.

I’m into being on my own, raising cats, long hair, tattoos, rock & metal, and cooking — all the good stuff.
