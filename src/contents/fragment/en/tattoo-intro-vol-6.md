All things lie hidden, waiting quietly for fortune to turn.

At the time, the space on my wrist was quite limited, so I kept thinking — the tale of "the carp leaping over the dragon gate" came to mind, along with the idea of "welcoming wealth and treasures." Eventually, I settled on the theme of “carp hugging a yuanbao (ingot).” as the sixth tattoo pattern.

Coincidentally, the cat already tattooed on my upper arm seemed ready to paw at the carp — a playful take on fortune-grabbing, haha.
