The third design reflects my identity as a devoted cat lover. It was originally based on Luna, my first cat after I started living on my own.

I brought her home in 2016 when she was just 51 days old.

Not long after I got the tattoo of the cat, I met my second cat, Didi. By coincidence, the design ended up becoming a blend of both of them.
