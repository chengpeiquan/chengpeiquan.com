This is the first tattoo of my life, inspired by my second bass guitar — a Japanese-made Fender AJB-M.

I was introduced to rock music through Beyond when I was a kid, and later got into punk, funk, nu-metal, hardcore, and other genres. The bass has always been familiar to me.

So when I first touched a real instrument at the end of 2014, I decided to get my own. Life hasn’t been boring since — even practicing alone has been a lot of fun!
