Following the thread from Vol.8, this is a tattoo I first envisioned back in 2022, when I moved from Shenzhen back to Guangzhou.
But after returning, life quickly got busy—and before I knew it, three years had passed.
Even so, this idea kept surfacing in my mind over the years, quietly lingering. And now, I’ve finally brought it to life.

The two stalks of grain come from Guangzhou’s poetic nickname, “Sui City” (穗城), and its ancient legend of the Five Rams carrying sheaves of grain.
They grow outward from either side of my bass tattoo, slowly rising over my shoulders—rooted together, growing as one.

Why am I so emotionally tied to Guangzhou?
Even after spending two years in the prosperous Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, I still kept thinking about coming back.
During that brief time of leaving and returning, I designing two tattoos about this city.

It’s hard to put the feeling into lofty words.
Maybe it’s just that, even when I was still a kid, the city’s deep history already spoke to me in ways I couldn’t explain.
And when I grew up—studying, working, and eventually standing on my own here—it grounded me, both spiritually and practically.
This city has become my roots.
