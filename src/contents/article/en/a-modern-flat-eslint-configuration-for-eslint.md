ESLint v9.0.0 is a major release of ESLint, it has several breaking changes, the biggest of which is the use of its configuration files and plugin ecosystem. You can learn how to migrate through the official website's [Migrate to v9.x](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/migrate-to-9.0.0#flat-config) document.

Here is an npm package for ESLint V9's flat configuration, which has some of my favorite ESLint configurations built in. This is also an open source project I published on GitHub. If it helps you, please [give it a Star](https://github.com/chengpeiquan/bassist) !
