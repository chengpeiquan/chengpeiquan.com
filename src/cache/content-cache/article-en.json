But I import them into vite.config.ts and found that them doesn't work. So, I try to learn the plugin development of vite, so there is this work, Its features is similar to WebPack bannerPlugin.\n\nIt follows Vite's plugin development specifications, It currently works normally in Vite 2.0, and it can inherit some options of vite.config, e.g. build.outDir.\n\n## Features\n\nAdds a banner to the top of each generated chunk.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall the package from npm (or yarn, or pnpm).\n\n## Options\n\n| Plugin Options Type | Description                     | Example                   |\n| :------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------ |\n| string              | The banner content              | Basic usage               |\n| BannerPluginOptions | See the type declarations below | Optional parameter format |\n\n· Type Declarations:\n\n## Usage\n\nIn most cases, just use the `String` format as a plugin option.\n\nIn some special cases, such as in VitePress, you might need to use `Object` format to pass in plugin options, see Optional parameter format.\n\n### Basic usage\n\nAdd it to `vite.config.ts`\n\nWhen you run `npm run build` on your project, In the `dist` folder(Or the build.outDir in `vite.config.ts` you configured), Except for `vendor` files, all `js` and `css` files will add a banner to the top.\n\ne.g. in `app.b3a7772e.js`:\n\n### Advanced usage\n\nOf course, the most ideal banner is related to your package information.\n\nFirst, You need to update your `package.json` like this, For example, it contains such field content:\n\nThen, import the `package.json` into `vite.config.ts`, update the banner like this:\n\nRun `npm run build`, you can see the banner become more detailed.\n\ne.g. in `app.6936be52.js`:\n\n### Fun usage\n\nIf you want to make some banners that show your personality, you can make some interesting content from some online generators.\n\nSuch as:\n\n* http\\://www\\.network-science.de/ascii/\n\n* https\\://www\\.bootschool.net/ascii\n\nRun `npm run build`, e.g. in `app.d9a287b8.js`:\n\n### Optional parameter format\n\nI'm not sure what other scenarios besides VitePress need to use this method to pass in options, so I use VitePress as an example, I hope it can give you a reference.\n\nWhy do it?\n\nBecause in VitePress, what you get through `viteConfig.build.outDir` is always a `.temp` temporary directory, not the final output directory, so you need to manually specify the output directory to inform the plugin.\n\nOf course, with the updated version of Vitepress, this is not necessarily required, but you can choose to do so when you need it.\n"
