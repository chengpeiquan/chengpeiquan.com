Hi, I'm Peiquan Cheng, Living in Guangdong Province, China, I am a front-end engineer.

I raised three cats:

- Luna: A black British Shorthair (Yeah! The same name as the black cat in Sailor Moon.)

- Lion: A red tabby Maine Coon Cat (It has grown up now and look like a lion.)

- Didi: A tabby American Shorthair (In Chinese, The name means younger brother.)

The photos below are the three of them.

After introducing my cat, it's my turn. You can call me "BASS" or "BASSSSSSS…", because I'm a Bassist when I free.

I enjoy Rock'N Roll, Nu-Metal, Hardcore, funk and so on. In my favorite music, the common denominator is to have charming riff, double Bass Drum Pedal, the most important point is that the bassline must be prominent.

I have compiled a prominent playlist of bass that is suitable for bands to play together. Friends who play bass can visit [The sense of Existence for BASS: rich and nice BASSline](https://music.163.com/#/playlist?id=443717710).

I like to cook, and I am determined to learn to cook 1,000 different dishes. Now, The current progress is about 60%.

I haven’t organized the album for a long time. I will reorganize it later. I will open a column on the blog to introduce it so that the majority of otaku can produce different dishes to have a wonderful life.
